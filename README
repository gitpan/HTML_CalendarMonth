HTML::CalendarMonth
-------------------

HTML::CalendarMonth is a module that simplifies the rendering of a
calendar month in HTML.  It is NOT a scheduling system.

HTML::CalendarMonth is a subclass of HTML::ElementTable. See the
HTML::ElementTable(3) manpage for how that class works, for it
affects this module on many levels. Like HTML::ElementTable,
HTML::CalendarMonth behaves as if it were an HTML::ElementSuper,
with methods added to easily manipulate the appearance of the
HTML table containing the calendar. In addition to the row and
column *cell* based methods provided in HTML::ElementTable,
there are analogous methods based on *items*, or the symbols
contained in the calendar cells. For instance, `$c->item(15)'
returns the cell containing the 15th, and `$c->item($c->year())'
returns the cell containing the year. Groups of item cells can
be manipulated as if they were single elements. For example,
`$c->daycol('Su')' would affect all days in the same column as
the 'Su' header.

The module includes support for 'week of the year' numbering,
arbitrary 1st day of the week definitions, and aliasing so that
you can express any element in any language HTML can handle.


INSTALLATION

You install HTML_Calendar, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DOCUMENTATION

See HTML/CalendarMonth.pm for the code. See Changes for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in the module.
This is normally converted to a manual page and installed as part
of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use
the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read documentation from the
module directly.

There should also be some examples on the web page mentioned below.
